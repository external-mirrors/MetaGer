Yahoo will send their response to us which we will then forward to you. This is how we handle every search request sent to us, no matter which one of the offered search engines you use. By doing this we commit ourselves to guarantee your privacy and do not save any personal data. It is possible to verify this, since the source code of MetaGer has been released under a free license <a href=\"https://gitlab.metager.de/open-source/MetaGer\">(https://gitlab.metager.de/open-source/MetaGer)</a>. If you have your own website you could try and find out how our <a href=":widget-link" target="_blank">MetaGer-Widget</a> works. You are also free to create links to our search engine.',
